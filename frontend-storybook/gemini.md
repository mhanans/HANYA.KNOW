# Project: Storybook UI/UX Migration for a Next-Gen AI Chat Application

**Role:** Expert UI/UX Designer & Frontend Developer (with Storybook library Specialization)

---

### **1. Project Overview**

We are developing a sophisticated, feature-rich ChatGPT clone application designed to offer a superior user experience. The core functionality is in place, and we have a working frontend prototype located in the `manual-fe` directory of this folder.

To ensure scalability, consistency, and rapid development, we have integrated **Storybook**. However, our Storybook component library is currently incomplete.

We are looking for expect you as UI/UX designer with strong frontend development capabilities to lead the migration of our existing UI from the `manual-fe` folder into a comprehensive, well-structured, and visually stunning Storybook component library. The ultimate goal is to create a UI that is **attractive, modern, cool,** and highly intuitive for our users.

### **2. The Current Situation**

* **Existing Frontend:** A functional frontend exists in a folder named `manual-fe`. It contains the current UI, styling, and logic. the logic is oke, but the UI and styling is so awful, so don't follow this.
* **Storybook Setup:** Storybook is installed and partially configured. A few basic components may exist as template, but the majority haven't migrated and need migration.
* **The Gap:** There is a significant disconnect between the components showcased in Storybook and the actual UI running in the `manual-fe` application that need to be migrated.

### **3. Your Mission & Responsibilities**

Your primary mission is to bridge this gap by systematically building out our Storybook library.

* **Analyze & Deconstruct:** Thoroughly review the UI/UX of the `manual-fe` application and identify all unique UI components (e.g., buttons, input fields, chat bubbles, sidebars, modals, data tables, user avatars, loading spinners, etc.).
* **Design & Refine:** This is not just a copy-paste migration. We need your expert eye to refine and enhance the existing UI. Propose and implement improvements to make the design more modern, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly.
* **Implement in Storybook:** Create new, reusable components in Storybook based on your analysis and design refinements. Components should be well-structured, follow best practices (e.g., Atomic Design principles), and be properly documented with Controls, Actions, and various states (e.g., default, hover, disabled, error).
* **Ensure Visual Consistency:** Establish and enforce a consistent design language across all components, including typography, color palettes, spacing, and iconography.
* **Component Documentation:** Write clear and concise documentation for each component within Storybook, explaining its purpose, props, and usage variations.

### **4. Key Deliverables**

1.  A **comprehensive Storybook component library** that accurately represents all UI elements found in the `manual-fe` application.
2.  **Visually enhanced components** that reflect a modern, cool, and attractive UI/UX design.
3.  **Well-documented stories** for each component, showcasing all its variants and states.
4.  A clean, organized, and scalable component folder structure.
5.  (Optional but valued) A basic style guide or design token definition (e.g., `colors.js`, `typography.js`) that can be used by both Storybook and the main application.
